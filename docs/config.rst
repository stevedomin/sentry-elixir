Configuration
=============

Configuration is handled using the standard elixir configuration.

Simply add configuration to the `:sentry` key in the file `config/prod.exs`: 
.. code-block:: elixir
  config :sentry,
    dsn: "https://public:secret@app.getsentry.com/1"

If using an environment with Plug or Phoenix add the following to your router: 

.. code-block:: elixir
  use Plug.ErrorHandler
  use Sentry.Plug

Optional settings
